# Vineyard Demo

Interactive 3D vineyard pruning demo. The real vineyard view now includes a
fourâ€‘wheel rover that drives between vines and uses a robotic arm to execute
stored cuts during replay.

The platform also supports automatic row-to-row transfers. Enter a row number
and press **Move** to send the rover up to the overhead rail, across to the
selected row and back down ready for teleoperation.
